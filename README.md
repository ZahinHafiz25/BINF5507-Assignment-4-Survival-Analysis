BINF5507 Assignment 4: Survival Analysis 

Part 1: The GitHub repository was set up and it includes the following: this README.md file, Assignment_4/main.ipynb file, and the Data/RADCURE_Clinical_v04_20241219.csv dataset.

Part 2: The clinical dataset, Data/RADCURE_Clinical_v04_20241219.csv, was loaded on VS Code, and data preprocessing steps (i.e. exclusion of columns, missing, and NA values) were performed for the subsequent Kaplan-Meier Analysis, Cox Proportional Hazards Regression, and Random Survival Forests models. 

Part 3: Built and Evaluated three models: Kaplan-Meier Analysis, Cox Proportional Hazards Regression, and Random Survival Forests respectively. For the Kaplan-Meier Analysis, three survival curves were generated for three distinct groups - Age group, Tumour Stage, and Treatment type; this was followed by the log-rank tests for each group combinations. For the Cox Proportional Hazards Regression, the three aforementioned covariates were used (for model prediction). For Random Survival Forests, variables such as age, treatment, and stage were used to build the model. The variable performance analysis was performed to identify the most predictive factors. Furthermore, a comparison was done between the model's concordance index (C-index) and the Cox regression. 

Part 4: The short answer question document was completed and submitted separately on Blackboard.
